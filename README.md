# Pokemon Explorer

A simple web app to discover and explore Pokemon. Search by name or ID, view stats and details, and save your favorites.

## How to run

Use a local dev server (e.g. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code/Cursor). Open the project folder and run the server.

## What it does

- **Search** — Enter a Pokemon name (e.g. pikachu) or ID (e.g. 25) to look it up
- **View** — See sprite, types, and stats for each Pokemon
- **Favorites** — Add Pokemon to a favorites list (stored in your browser)

Built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and vanilla JavaScript. Uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for data.
